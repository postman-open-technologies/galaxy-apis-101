/*
POSTMAN GALAXY APIs 101

This API works in conjunction with the Postman Galaxy APIs 101 collection in Postman to walk you through API basics.
Import the collection into Postman from the workspace shared during the session and send a request to the setup endpoint to begin.


This Glitch app is based on hello-express and low-db.

Below you'll see the code for the endpoints in the API after some initial setup processing
  - each endpoint begins "app." followed by get, post, patch, put, or delete, then the endpoint path, e.g. /cat
